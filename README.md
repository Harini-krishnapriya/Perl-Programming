## Introduction to Perl and Setting Up Your Environment
  - Perl is a high-level, interpreted programming language.
  - It is well known for its flexibility and powerful text-processing capabilities.
  - Perl runs on various platforms, including Unix/Linux, Windows, and macOS.
  - It is robust language used for a wide range of applications, including system administration, web development, and network programming.
### Setup Environment

To get started with Perl programming, you'll need a good Integrated Development Environment (IDE). We recommend using [Padre, the Perl IDE](https://padre.perlide.org/).

#### Why Padre?

- **User-Friendly**: Simple to download and use.
- **Quick Start**: Helps you start programming quickly and efficiently.
- **Features**: Provides a range of tools and features to streamline your development process.

#### Installation Steps

1. **Download**: Click [here](https://padre.perlide.org/) to download Padre.
2. **Install**: Follow the installation instructions provided on the website.
3. **Launch**: Open Padre and start coding!

By following these steps, you'll be set up with a powerful IDE that makes Perl programming easier and more enjoyable.

## Basic Syntax and Variables

Perl is known for its flexibility and expressive power. Here are some key elements of Perl's syntax:

### Comments

Comments in Perl begin with a `#` symbol and continue to the end of the line.

```perl
# This is a comment
```

### Print Statement

To print a statement, we use the `print` function.

### First Perl Program
Hereâ€™s a simple Perl program that demonstrates the basic syntax
```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

print "Hello, world.\n";
```
Save this file with a `.pl` extension, for example: `basic_program.pl`.
Now run the code, you will get Hello, world. as an output

#### Purpose of using `#!/usr/bin/perl`
- The line `#!/usr/bin/perl` at the beginning of a Perl script is called a shebang or hashbang.
- It's a special directive used in Unix-like operating systems (such as Linux and macOS) to indicate the path to the interpreter that should be used to execute the script.
- It makes the Perl script itself executable. Without the shebang line, you would typically need to explicitly call Perl followed by the script name to run it (e.g., perl script.pl). 

### Variables and Data Types
Perl supports several types of variables and data types.
#### Scalar Variables
Scalar variables in Perl are used to store single values, which can be a number, a string, or a reference. Scalar variables are prefixed with a dollar sign (`$`).
```perl
my $number = 42;         # An integer
my $string = "Hello!";   # A string
my $float = 3.14;        # A floating-point number
my $reference = \$number; # A reference to another variable
```
#### Arrays
Arrays store ordered lists of scalars. Array variables are prefixed with an `@` sign. Individual elements of an array are accessed using the `$` sign with the array name and the index in square brackets.
```perl
my @numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5);       # An array of integers
my @words = ("apple", "banana", "cherry"); # An array of strings

# Accessing elements
print $numbers[0];  # Outputs 1
print $words[1];    # Outputs "banana"
```
**Note**: Arrays starts with index 0

#### Hashes
Hashes (associative arrays) store sets of key-value pairs. Hash variables are prefixed with a percent sign (`%`). Keys and values are scalars, and individual values are accessed using the `$` sign with the hash name and the key in curly braces.
``` Perl
my %fruit_colors = (
    "apple"  => "red",
    "banana" => "yellow",
    "grape"  => "purple"
);

# Accessing values
print $fruit_colors{"apple"};   # Outputs "red"
print $fruit_colors{"banana"};  # Outputs "yellow"
```
### Data Types
Perl supports various data types within its scalar, array, and hash variables:

#### 1. Numbers

- **Integers**: Whole numbers, positive or negative.
- **Floating-Point Numbers**: Numbers with decimal points.
- **Scientific Notation**: Numbers represented in scientific notation.
```perl
my $integer = 42;
my $float = 3.14159;
my $sci = 1.23e4;  # 1.23 x 10^4
```
#### 2. Strings
Strings are sequences of characters. They can be defined using single quotes (') or double quotes ("). Double quotes allow variable interpolation and special character sequences (escape sequences).
```Perl
my $single_quoted = 'Hello, World!';
my $double_quoted = "Hello, $name!";
my $escaped = "Line 1\nLine 2";
```
#### 3. References
References are scalars that "point" to other data types (arrays, hashes, subroutines, etc.). They are created using the backslash operator (`\`) and dereferenced using the appropriate symbol.
```perl
# Array reference
my @array = (1, 2, 3);
my $array_ref = \@array;

# Dereference
print $array_ref->[0];  # Outputs 1

# Hash reference
my %hash = (foo => 1, bar => 2);
my $hash_ref = \%hash;

# Dereference
print $hash_ref->{foo}; # Outputs 1
```
